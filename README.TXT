USER INSTRUCTIONS:

Define the initial variable for the world. 
	Multidimensional Array.  What datatype?
Randomly populate the world. Cells are either alive or dead.

The act() method runs the simulation. During act() you should:
  Generate a new world based on the current world
  (See rules)
  Replace current world with new world
